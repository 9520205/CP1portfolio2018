# Alex Shepherd's programming portfolio
## Computer Programming 1 portfolio


###This is my programming portfolio from my Computer Programming 1 class, taken the full school year of 2017-18. It contains all of my code, written in Java mode Processing, Python (done in Idle), and Python mode Processing.

Using Processing in Java mode...


Here is a fully-functional calculator: [ATG Calculator](https://github.com/9520205/CP1portfolio2018/blob/master/ATG_Calculator_Dec._2017)


Here is a bit of a rough timeline of computer history: [Computer History Timeline](https://github.com/9520205/CP1portfolio2018/blob/master/Computer_History_Timeline_Oct._2017)


Here is a screen saver I made in class as a bit of a fun project: [Kapptie Screen Saver](https://github.com/9520205/CP1portfolio2018/blob/master/Kapptie_Screen_Saver_Nov._2017)


Here is the very first code I ever wrote: [Shapes](https://github.com/9520205/CP1portfolio2018/blob/master/Shapes_Oct._2017)


Using Python (Idle 3.6.3 Python or Processing in Python mode)...


Here is a simple app i've made that will write out the 99 bottle ssong all the way to zero: 
[99 Bottles of Beer 'App'](https://github.com/9520205/CP1portfolio2018/blob/master/PYTHON%20CODE/99_Bottles_of_Beer_'App'_Jan._2018)


Here is a program that can guess your current age, down to the month (NOTE: This code actually might not work): 
[Guess Your Age](https://github.com/9520205/CP1portfolio2018/blob/master/PYTHON%20CODE/Guess_Your_Age_Feb._2018)


And finally...


Here is a project me and a group of other python people were working on. It's obviously not finished: [SnakeGame](https://github.com/Cosmaniac/PythonGroupGame/tree/master/SnakeGame)
